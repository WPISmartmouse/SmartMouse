##Smartmouse meeting minutes 8/28/12
 
         Faculty Advisor Putnam
·         Micromouse competition video
·         Brown competition
·         Context: robot built in one night, programmed on the drive over. (Just in time Programming)
·         Competition this year TBA
·         Other meeting review
o   (see notes)
·         Review of last year’s robot
o   Discussed wheels, encoders, closed-loop feedback
o   More stable wheel base
o   Sensors – slow IR, alignment, finicky optical, min range sonar
o   Bad maze tolerances – wonkey!
·         Find a competition – or two!
·         Maybe run our own??
·         Improvements for this year
o   Xbee/Bluetooth
o   Amarino software – Bluetooth/android/arduino library (www.amarino-toolkit.net/)
·         Timeline:
o   Chassis are quick with reprap!
o   Have hardware, have maze
o   Have testbed robot for software
o   New design by end of A term (~2 months)
o   Old robot as software dev platform
o   New hardware
#  100%
·         Modular design – swap components
·         4 motors, 4 wheels
·         Higher clearance
·         Fixed optical sensors for movement tracking
·         X-Y dimensions < 10x10cm
·         Wireless debugging
#  50%
·         IR sensors
·         Sonar system (longer range for mapping)
·         Encoders (with high wheel rpm can just use 1 tick/motor rev)
·         IMU (accelerometer, gyro, compass) for de-biasing
·         Better wheels
·         Need feedback on motors
·         Whiskers
#  Castors
·         Castors
·         Laser
·         Vision
  Parallax vs. maxbotics sensors
§  Maxbotics ping modules with custom hardware/software
§  Offload sensor handling (and other stuff) to other processors
·         Ideas
o    
·         Goals
o   More members at more meetings
o   PROTOTYPE throughout –PROTOTYPE everything – PROTOTYPE early!!!
